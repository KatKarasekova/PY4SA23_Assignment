The Hutton NSIS Open Data includes both a shapefile and an Esri format File Geodatabase. The shapefile is restricted to 10 characters in the field names so some are slightly obscure as are some of the values. Please refer to the NSIS_1_10km_grid_gh.xlsx file for clarification.

The file geodatabase includes two layers, both with a field name alias with the complete attribute name for those fields shown in Scotland's Soils. One layer uses the codes of the attribute values, the other uses the full text values taken from the spreadsheet named above.

Please contact David Donnelly, Allan Lilly or Gordon Hudson for clarification if required.
